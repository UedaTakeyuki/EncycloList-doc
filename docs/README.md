# EncycloList

## What is EncycloList
A Web application to display the list which is written in the [Enclst Notation](https://github.com/UedaTakeyuki/EncLst/blob/main/README.md#enclst-notation) of which Items consists of a **website URL** and its **title**, and opens the URL in which selected Item.

### What is the Enclst Notation
A notation rule for **humans** to write a list structure concisely. Because **JSON** is **NOT easy** for **humans** to write **without any errors** due to its pitfalls as follows:

- Prohibition of dangling commas
- String escaping

The Enclst notation is designed to avoid both:

- commas of the end of each item
- string escaping
